### Challenge 1: Palindrome Checker
**Description:**
Check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

**Solution Overview:**
- Convert the input string to lowercase and remove any spaces or punctuation.
- Use two pointers (one starting from the beginning and the other from the end of the string) to compare characters until they meet in the middle.
- If all characters match, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.

### Challenge 2: Fibonacci Sequence
**Description:**
Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

**Solution Overview:**
- Use an iterative approach to generate the Fibonacci sequence.
- Start with the first two terms (0 and 1) and calculate subsequent terms by adding the two previous terms.

### Challenge 3: Prime Number Checker
**Description:**
Check if a given integer is a prime number.

**Solution Overview:**
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
- Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

### Challenge 4: Anagram Checker
**Description:**
Check if two input strings are anagrams of each other.

**Solution Overview:**
- An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another.
- Sort the characters of both strings and compare them for equality.

### Challenge 5: Factorial Calculation
**Description:**
Calculate the factorial of a given number.

**Solution Overview:**
- The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
- Use an iterative approach to calculate the factorial.

### Challenge 6: Reverse a String
**Description:**
Reverse a given input string.

**Solution Overview:**
- Convert the input string to a character array and reverse it.
- Return the reversed array as a string.

### Challenge 7: Find Largest Number
**Description:**
Find the largest number in a list of numbers.

**Solution Overview:**
- Iterate through the list and keep track of the largest number found.

### Challenge 8: Find Smallest Number
**Description:**
Find the smallest number in a list of numbers.

**Solution Overview:**
- Iterate through the list and keep track of the smallest number found.

### Challenge 9: Sort a List
**Description:**
Sort a list of numbers in ascending order.

**Solution Overview:**
- Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the list.
- Repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
