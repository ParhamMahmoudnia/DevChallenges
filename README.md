### Challenge 1: Palindrome Checker
**Description:**
Check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

**Solution Overview:**
- Convert the input string to lowercase and remove any spaces or punctuation.
- Use two pointers (one starting from the beginning and the other from the end of the string) to compare characters until they meet in the middle.
- If all characters match, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.

## Getting Started
